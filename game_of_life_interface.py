        Input size_of_board donates the size of the board, is an integer bigger than 9 and smaller than 1000.
        board_start_mode donates the starting position options, please refer to the added PDF file. Is an integer.
        rules donates the rules of the game. Is a string
        rle: is a str[optional]. the coding for a pattern, if there is an rle coding than the board_start_mode is overlooked,
             if there isn't an rle, than use the board_start_mode.
        pattern_position: is a tuple of two integers (x,y). the upper left position of the pattern on the board,
                          only used if in rle mode.
